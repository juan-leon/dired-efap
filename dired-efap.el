;;; Commentary:

;; dired-efap.el allows the user to edit the filename at point, by hitting
;; a key (like f2) or double-clicking it.  The name is edited in the dired
;; buffer, and the renaming takes effect when the user hits the RET
;; key.  Only the name of the file at point is tangible and editable, and it
;; uses an special font.
;;
;; This package provides a similar user interface to renaming files to the
;; interface used by some graphical file managers (or "explorers", however they
;; are called).
;;
;; The idea for this file was originated from a suggestion I received from Eli
;; Tziperman to improve wdired.
;;
;; Comments, bug reports and ideas welcomed

;;; Usage:

;; Add this file to your load-path and this line to your config file:
;;
;; (require 'dired-efap)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map [f2] 'dired-efap)
;;
;; To edit a name you can hit f2 (or the mapping of your choosing) or
;; double-click over it. Pressing RET the file is actually renamed.  C-g
;; aborts.
;;
;; The behavior of the mouse can be customized. There are three options:
;; double-click to edit, click once in the file where the cursor is (this
;; includes double-click, because the first click moves the cursor) and
;; disallow the use of the mouse to edit names. See and customize the
;; variable `dired-efap-use-mouse' to change the default behavior of
;; double-click to edit
;;
;; You can customize also the face of the name being edited. This face is
;; called `dired-efap-face'
;;
;; Type M-x customize-group RET dired-efap if you want make changes to
;; the default behavior.

;;; Change Log:

;; 0.8
;;
;; - Now `dired-efap-face' works on modern Emacs versions, and the default
;;   face works well both with dark and light backgrounds, as well as text
;;   terminals.
;;
;; - Now, initial filename selection works properly.  Variable to customize
;;   the behavior is renamed to `dired-efap-initial-filename-selection'.
;;
;; - A lot of dirty hacks removed from code
